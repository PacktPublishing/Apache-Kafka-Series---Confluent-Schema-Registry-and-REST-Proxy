## About the Video Course
This is the new volume in the Apache Kafka Series! Learn Apache Avro, the confluent schema registry for Apache Kafka and the confluent REST proxy for Apache Kafka. Join hundreds of knowledge savvy students in learning some of the most important components in a typical Apache Kafka stack. Apache Avro is one of the most powerful and most popular fast data serialisation mechanism with Apache Kafka: Schema is a first class citizen of the data; data serialisation format that is lightweight; documentation is embedded in the schema; easy to read and write using many languages; fast and big data de-facto data serialisation format. Confluent schema registry for Apache Kafka is the de-facto standard way of storing Avro schemas for your Apache Kafka topics: Stores a versioned history of all your schemas in Apache Kafka; supports and enforces conditions for schema evolution (backward, forward, full compatibility): Kafka Avro serialiser and deserialiser automatically integrate with Apache Kafka and confluent schema registry; make your messages much smaller and lighter! Perfect for increasing Apache Kafka throughput and performance. Confluent REST Proxy is the perfect way to communicate for sending Avro data using non Java languages to Apache Kafka: Write and read binary, JSON and Avro data to Apache Kafka using an HTTP REST API; interact with Apache Kafka using any programming language (not just Java); consult topic list and topic metadata in Apache Kafka
